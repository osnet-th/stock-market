Conventions from CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md: DDD layered architecture; domain packages by feature. Entities must not use relationships; ID-only references. TDD mandatory for non-infrastructure and non-presentation layers: write failing unit test first, then minimal implementation; mocks only at boundary; no mocks in domain. Avoid large refactors or public API changes without explicit request. Get approval before any file creation or modification. Use @RequiredArgsConstructor for DI. Domain models should be behavior-rich (avoid anemic).
